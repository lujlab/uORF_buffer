# uORF_buffer

This repository stores the scripts used for simulation of the translation process of an mRNA molecule. The model used here is based on Andreev et al.'s ICIER model [(ref)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32563), which is distributed under GPLv3 licence at the following address: [https://github.com/maximarnold/uORF_TASEP_ICIER](https://github.com/maximarnold/uORF_TASEP_ICIER). The original model is implemented in MATLAB, and we adpated it using python.


## Usage of the scripts
The core components of the model is integrated into the file [ICIER_extended_v8.py](https://github.com/lujlab/uORF_buffer/blob/main/ICIER_extended_v8.py). The function `Sim_main(condition_set)` executes a single run of simulation. Based on the previous one, the function `Sim_multi_condition(condition_list, outfile_path)` executes multiple runs of simulation.
`Sim_main(condition_set)` takes a dictionary as the only input, and the requisite items of the dictionary can be found at the begining of [ICIER_extended_v8.py](https://github.com/lujlab/uORF_buffer/blob/main/ICIER_extended_v8.py), in the `default_condition_set`. Such a dictionary specifies all parameters necessary for a single run of simulation.
`Sim_multi_condition(condition_list, outfile_path)` takes two input objects, where `condition_list` is a list of dictionaries that fit `Sim_main()`, and `outfile_path` is the path of a text file that you want to write the results into.
For a batch of simulation, you need to first creat a list of dictionaries, then utilize `Sim_multi_condition(condition_list, outfile_path)`. This can be done with a separate script, let's take [1000Lambda_runif__11P_s2p_u__11P_s2p_m__v8_downstream_dissociation.py](https://github.com/lujlab/uORF_buffer/blob/main/1000Lambda_runif__11P_s2p_u__11P_s2p_m__v8_downstream_dissociation.py) as an example. In this script, we simulated translation processes under 1000 values of Lambda (generated by a random generator of uniform distribution), 11 values of P_s2p_u (0, 0.1, 0.2,..., 1) and 11 values of P_s2p_m (0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1), thus there are a total of 1000\*11\*11 = 121000 runs of simulation.
