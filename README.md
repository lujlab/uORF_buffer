# uORF_buffer

This repository stores the scripts used for simulation of the translation process of an mRNA molecule. The model used here is based on Andreev et al.'s ICIER model [(ref)][https://elifesciences.org/articles/32563], which is distributed under GPLv3 licence at the following address: [https://github.com/maximarnold/uORF_TASEP_ICIER][https://github.com/maximarnold/uORF_TASEP_ICIER]. The original model is implemented in MATLAB, and we adpated it using python.
